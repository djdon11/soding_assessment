# soding_assessment


This is for an assessment test. 

To run this test:

Go to the file location and type Ruby {filename.rb}

This will return a digit that is a sum of longest consecutive prime numbers. And this sum is also a prime number.

Currently it is set to provide the sum of consecutive prime numbers up to one million. To change this number you can change within the file to provide new input number other than one million.
